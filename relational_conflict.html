        Addressing Relational Conflict
      </h1>
<img class="pictures" src="relationalconflict/julian.jpg" alt="">
      <p class="section-content">
        How do I repair this relationship?
        Why don’t I have close relationships?
        Why does my family treat me this way?
        Why do I have trouble connecting with others?
        Is this conflict my fault?
        Should I stay with my partner?
      </p>

      <p class="section-content">
        If you find yourself asking these questions, it may be time to seek
        counseling services. All people can relate to finding themselves in
        opposition with another person. Sometimes this opposition goes beyond
        what we know how to navigate on our own or surpasses what feels like
        healthy conflict. When our relationships with others are struggling it
        can cause us to have doubts, confusion, and emotional suffering. At Better
        Life Therapy we can help you navigate relational conflict and feel supported.
        Our therapists use a variety of interventions to best fit your personal
        situation and experiences. Some theories that they are trained to use
        and aid clients with are Dialectical Behavior Theory (DBT), Acceptance
        and Commitment Theory (ACT), Cognitive Behavioral Theory (CBT), and
        Psychodynamic Theory. More about these approaches can be found below.
        Clients can learn how to set and respect boundaries within any of their
        relationships in order to help their relationships flourish. Resolving
        relational conflict also involves addressing power dynamics and accepting
        that the only control any person has is over their own self and that we do
        not have power to control others.

<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <h1 class="header">
      Common Relational Conflicts
    </h1>
<div class="col-lg-6">
    <p class="section-content">
      Familial Conflict- Family systems are more diverse than ever in today’s age.
      Whether your family is large or small, blended or atomic, just starting out,
      or multigenerational, you may go through seasons of hardship as it grows and
      evolves. Some common familial difficulties are sharing space, rearing children,
      sibling feuds, and disagreements on everyday things.
    </p>

    <p class="section-content">
      Conflict between Parents and Children-Whether you are a parent or not,
      everyone has been someone’s child even if they’ve never known their parents.
      These conflicts can cause emotional distress even when parents and children
      are not in contact with one another. Frustrations can be felt in both directions
      over expectations of the others role and how to interact with one another.
      Parents may want to be more involved in their children’s day to day or may
      want more time for themselves without their children. Children may feel
      like their parents do not treat them as they treat their siblings or that
      their parents have done or haven’t done something for or to them that is
      unforgivable. There are many reasons why parents and children may not see
      eye to eye or feel understood and respected by one another but the stress
      from these conflicts can be resolved if one or both parties decides to work
      through the conflict in order to move forward.
    </p>

      <img src="relationalconflict/family.jpg" alt="">
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-6">
    <p class="section-content">
        Sibling Conflicts- Sibling conflict can relate to parents but can also
        arise between siblings despite parent actions. Siblings are known for
        having rivalries and for frustration relating to their similarities and
        differences. These conflicts can arise or reoccur throughout the lifespan.
        Age differences, parenting differences, and opinions on how each other
        should relate to parents can all be reasons for conflict. Additionally,
        half and step siblings may have additional reasons for conflict relating
        to how the families have blended.
    </p>
    <p class="section-content">
      Partner conflict- Partner conflict can relate to individuals who are in
      courtships, relationships, married, or even divorced. Partners can be in
      conflict about how they are defining their relationship and the boundaries
      of it. It can even be about how they are relating and acting toward one another.
      Not everyone shows and receives love in the same ways and this can be
      challenging to learn about one another if communication, understanding and
      effort aren’t going all directions. Partners can also experience conflicts
      over differing opinions and values and how to move forward from these.
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col">
    <p class="section-content">
        Interpersonal Violence- Interpersonal violence can be referred to in
        many ways, such as intimate partner violence, domestic violence, sexual
        assault, rape, or other physical abuse. This is any kind of conflict that
        reaches a point of physical harm between individuals. We do not recommend joint or couples counseling
        for individuals who have experienced interpersonal violence between each other.
        Interpersonal violence can happen between people that previously did or
        did not know each other and survivors can experience negative symptoms
        for years after the incidence. Incidences of violence can be isolated or
        on going for extended periods of time. Healing from interpersonal
        violence can look different for each individual but at Better Life Therapy
        we work alongside clients to support them as they navigate their healing journey.
    </p>
    <p class="section-content">
        Friend conflict- Conflict between friends is bound to happen at some point
        in most friendships. Differing opinions, miscommunications, misunderstandings,
        and even out right disrespect can all be sources of conflict between friends.
        Friends may even feel conflict because of changing friendship dynamics
        or feeling left out by a pair or group of friends. Learning how to
        navigate friendships with healthy boundaries and even when and how to end
        friendships that are no longer serving our clients are common issues
        that our therapists are ready to help with.
